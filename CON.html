      <h3><U>Result:</U></h3>
      <p>The correlation seems to be the most impacted by the faith adopted per country; since the 2000s.</p>
      <h3><U>Hurdles:</U></h3>
      <p>I did not always get the expected results when visualizing the data, for instance, the Franc CFA countries were hypothesized to be the most unstable and with the weakest economies.</p>
      <h3><U>Limitations:</U></h3>
      <p>Lack of more complex scores. Political stability could be calculated using terrorism rates, the level of accountability of the leaders, and freedom of the media. Economic prosperity could benefit the inclusion of literacy rates, the “strength” of their passport, and how their “second-class citizens” are treated (homeless, prisoners, migrants, etc.).</p>
